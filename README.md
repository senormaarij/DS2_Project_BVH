# DS2_Project_BVH

Welcome to our Data Structures 2 project for Habib universiy. Myself and my partners have decided to implement Bounding Volume Heirarchies(BVH) to display in our project. The best and easiest way to know what BVH is that it is a data structure used in commonly in computer graphics , collision detection, and ray tracing.  BVH is an efficient spatial partitioning method that organizes objects in a tree structure, facilitating fast intersection tests and efficient rendering.

# Features: 

. Implementation of BVH construction algorithms.
. Efficient intersection tests for ray tracing.
